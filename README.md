## Challenges
The most challenging part of the assessment was only having two hours to work on the project. I wanted to be able to complete every task; however, ultimately, I needed to make a few tough decisions and trade offs. The hardest task for me was configuring the various APIs provided. I wanted to create a separate folder that would house the API environments in order to make the application more scalable

## Most Proud

I am most proud of the clean structure of my code. I put a strong emphasis on defining the unique components that I would need beforehand. Also, I am proud of how quickly I was able to create the form and the post request for adding reviews

## Least Proud

I am least proud of the work that I did on rendering the reviews. Since I knew I was going to run out of time, I was unable to make a separate path for each product's reviews. Instead, I had to house every single review together. 

## Tradeoffs

I spent a good amount of time on the frontend api integrations as well as the functinality for posting reviews. Ultimately, I had to make the decision to not focus as much on the review section for each product. Also, although I was able to do a decent amount of UI work, I definitely would have spent more time making the application for attractive to the user.


## Feedback

I thought this was a great exercise to test frontend API integration skills. It was challenging, but extremely rewarding, and I am definitely proud of the finished project. I am looking forward to having the team review!
